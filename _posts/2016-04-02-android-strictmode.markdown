Not many of you may heard about Strict Mode in Android. Added in Api Level 9, it is a developer tool which detects those part of codes that may crash due to some voilations, and brings them to your attention with a error code that is easy to understand.

It can be used to catch various types of errors/voilations which has been discussed below:

There are various reasons for this integration, including:

* #### Disk IO on Main Thread
  Catch all accidental disk operations taking place on the main thread.

* #### Network Access on Main Thread
  Catch all kind of network operations that are taking place in the main thread.

* #### Leaked Objects
  Detect all kind of leaked objects such as sql, cursors and much more.


So, StrictMode is most commonly used to catch accidental disk or network access on the application's main thread, where UI operations are received and animations take place. Keeping disk and network operations off the main thread makes for much smoother, more responsive applications. [Source](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/StrictMode.html)


### How to enable Strict Mode?

Enabling strict mode is just a piece of cake. Just few lines of code in your application class, and its over. Whenever there are some voilations, it will crash the application with the error log.

* NOTE : Strict Mode should only be used in DEBUG mode.

{% highlight groovy %}
public void onCreate() {
    if (DEVELOPER_MODE) {
        StrictMode.setThreadPolicy(new StrictMode.ThreadPolicy.Builder()
        .detectDiskReads()
        .detectDiskWrites()
        .detectNetwork()   // or .detectAll() for all detectable problems
        .penaltyLog()
        .build());
    
        StrictMode.setVmPolicy(new StrictMode.VmPolicy.Builder()
        .detectLeakedSqlLiteObjects()
        .detectLeakedClosableObjects()
        .penaltyLog()
        .penaltyDeath()
        .build());
    }
    super.onCreate();
}
{% endhighlight %}


Easy Right? Enable strict mode in your Application class, and make sure your programmers, and you (obviously :P) write codes in such a way that it prevents [ANR dialogs](http://developer.android.com/training/articles/perf-anr.html) from being shown to users.
